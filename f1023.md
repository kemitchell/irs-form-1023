## Part IX.  Financial Data

For purposes of this schedule, years in existence refer to completed tax years.

1.  If in existence less than 5 years, complete the statement for each year in existence and provide projections of your likely revenues and expenses based on a reasonable and good faith estimate of your future finances for a total of:

  1.  Three years of financial information if you have not completed one tax year, or

  2.  Four years of financial information if you have completed one tax year.  See instructions.

2.  If in existence 5 or more years, complete the schedule for the most recent 5 tax years.  You will need to provide a separate statement that includes information about the most recent 5 tax years because the data table in Part IX has not been updated to provide for a 5th year.  See instructions.

## Part X.  Public Charity Status

Part X is designed to classify you as an organization that is either a **private foundation** or a **public charity**.  Public charity status is a more favorable tax status than private foundation status.  If you are a private foundation, Part X is designed to further determine whether you are a **private operating foundation**.  See instructions.

### 1

#### a

Are you a private foundation?  If "Yes," go to line 1b.  If "No," go to line 5 and proceed as instructed.  If you are unsure, see the instructions.

- [ ] Yes

- [ ] No

#### b

As a private foundation, section 508(e) requires special provisions in your organizing document in addition to those that apply to all organizations described in section 501(c)(3).  Check the box to confirm that your organizing document meets this requirement, whether by express provision or by reliance on operation of state law.  Attach a statement that describes specifically where your organizing document meets this requirement, such as a reference to a particular article or section in your organizing document or by operation of state law.  See the instructions, including Appendix B, for information about the special provisions that need to be contained in your organizing document.  Go to line 2.

- [ ] Confirm

### 2

Are you a private operating foundation?  To be a private operating foundation you must engage directly in the active conduct of charitable, religious, educational, and similar activities, as opposed to indirectly carrying out these activities by providing grants to individuals or other organizations.  If "Yes," go to line 3.  If "No," go to the signature section of Part XI.

- [ ] Yes

- [ ] No

### 3

Have you existed for one or more years?  If "Yes," attach financial information showing that you are a private operating foundation; go to the signature section of Part XI.  If "No," continue to line 4.

### 4

Have you attached either (1) an affidavit or opinion of counsel, (including a written affidavit or opinion from a certified public accountant or accounting firm with expertise regarding this tax law matter), that sets forth facts concerning your operations and support to demonstrate that you are likely to satisfy the requirements to be classified as a private operating foundation; or (2) a statement describing your proposed operations as a private operating foundation?

- [ ] Yes

- [ ] No

### 5

If you answered "No" to line 1a, indicate the type of public charity status you are requesting by checking one of the choices below.  You may check only one box.

The organization is not a private foundation because it is:

- [ ] a: 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(i)---a church or a convention or association of churches.  Complete and attach Schedule A.
